"After Back From The War," This is my first project.

Todo List App By JavaScript with all functions.
CRUD
C = mean, create a new Task. 
R = mean Read The Task 
Update =  the task when you need
D= Delete the task when you need or when the task is complete 

also, the todo app contains the condition if the task is is complete and I make it as ui for user experience enhancement.
